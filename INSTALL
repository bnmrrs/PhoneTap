PhoneTap Install Guide
======================
This guide assumes that you have the OSX SDK installed although can you follow Google's instructions online at http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/devenvironment.html for windows or linux.  If you run into any problems I'm available most days on Skype at bmorris98 or gtalk at ben.morris99@gmail.com


Step One: Creating the application
==================================
* If you do not already have an AppEngine account you must create one now at https://appengine.google.com
* Log into your account and click "Create an application"
* The application identifier can be whatever you'd like but make sure you remember it, we'll use it later
* The application title can be whatever you'd like
* Leave the Auth and Google Accounts as the default
* Click "Create Application" and then go to the dashboard


Step Two: Preparing the application
===================================
* Clone the PhoneTap git repository at git://github.com/bnmrrs/PhoneTap.git
* Edit PhoneTap/app.yaml and change the application variable to the "application identifier" you used in step one
* Edit PhoneTap/phonetap/settings.py and change the SENDER_EMAIL variable to the google account email that you used to create your AppEngine application


Step Three: Adding the application to the AppEngine SDK and deploying
=====================================================================
* Open up the AppEngine SDK and go to file > add existing application
* Browse to the path where you cloned the PhoneTap Repo and then click "Add"
* Click "Deploy" and enter your AppEngine credentials
* A log dialog should pop up and show the deployment progress
* After a few seconds it should say "Closing update: new version is ready to start serving." and then "*** appcfg.py has finished with exit code 0 ***"


Step Four: Making sure everything worked
========================================
* You can now go to http://<Your App Identifier>.appspot.com and test out the application
